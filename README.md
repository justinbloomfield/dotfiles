# dotfiles

.fyls

managed with cstow

## Installing

1. Clone repo into a folder in your home directory (I use ".dotfiles" as mine, so that it's out of sight)
2. Enter this folder
3. Execute "cstow \<whatever\>" and it will install the files for the program/folder/whatever into the "right" spot automagically. Amazing!

*You can also use GNU Stow, which actually has more features IIRC, but I'm too lazy to make a package for it so I just use cstow*
